# Channel

## Channel Establishment


Channel establishment begins immediately after authentication, and
consists of the funding node sending an `open_channel` message, which
includes a partial funding transaction.
The responding node replies with `accept_channel` which may include additional 
inputs for the funding transaction ("dual funding"), and a signature for the
funder's first commitment transaction as described in [BOLT 03](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/03-transactions.md#bolt-3-bitcoin-transaction-and-script-formats).
The funding node then sends a `funding_created` message that includes a signature for the responder's first
commitment transaction, and the responder replies with a `funding_signed` message that includes
signatures for all the funding inputs that they added in their `accept_channel` message.
Both nodes now have a signed commitment transaction, and the funding node has a fully signed funding transaction that
they can broadcast.  
After the `funding_signed` message is sent/received, both sides should wait
for the funding transaction to enter the blockchain and reach their
specified depth (number of confirmations). After both sides have sent
the `funding_locked` message, the channel is established and can begin
normal operation. The `funding_locked` message includes information
which will be used to construct channel authentication proofs.


        +-------+                              +-------+
        |       |--(1)---  open_channel  ----->|       |
        |       |<-(2)--  accept_channel  -----|       |
        |       |                              |       |
        |   A   |--(3)--  funding_created  --->|   B   |
        |       |<-(4)--  funding_signed  -----|       |
        |       |                              |       |
        |       |--(5)--- funding_locked  ---->|       |
        |       |<-(6)--- funding_locked  -----|       |
        +-------+                              +-------+


If this fails at any stage, or a node decides that the channel terms
offered by the other node are not suitable, the channel establishment
fails.

Note that multiple channels can operate in parallel, as all channel
messages are identified by either a `temporary_channel_id` (before the
funding transaction is created) or `channel_id` derived from the
funding transaction.

### The `open_channel` message


This message contains information about a node, and indicates its
desire to set up a new channel.

1. type: 32 (`open_channel`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`chain_hash`]
   * [`32`:`temporary_channel_id`]
   * [`8`:`funding_satoshis`]
   * [`8`:`push_msat`]
   * [`8`:`dust_limit_satoshis`]
   * [`8`:`max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat`]
   * [`8`:`channel_reserve_satoshis`]
   * [`8`:`htlc_minimum_msat`]
   * [`4`:`feerate_per_kw`]
   * [`2`:`to_self_delay`]
   * [`2`:`max_accepted_htlcs`]
   * [`33`:`funding_pubkey`]
   * [`33`:`revocation_basepoint`]
   * [`33`:`payment_basepoint`]
   * [`33`:`delayed_payment_basepoint`]
   * [`33`:`first_per_commitment_point`]
   * [`1`:`channel_flags`]
   * [`2`: `len`]
   * [`len`: `partial_funding_tx`]


The `chain_hash` value denotes the exact blockchain the opened channel will
reside within. This is usually the genesis hash of the respective blockchain.
The existence of the `chain_hash` allows nodes to open channel
across many distinct blockchains as well as have channels within multiple
blockchains opened to the same peer (if they support the target chains).

The `temporary_channel_id` is used to identify this channel until the funding transaction is established. `funding_satoshis` is the amount the sender is putting into the channel.  `dust_limit_satoshis` is the threshold below which outputs should not be generated for this node's commitment or HTLC transaction; ie. HTLCs below this amount plus HTLC transaction fees are not enforceable on-chain.  This reflects the reality that tiny outputs are not considered standard transactions and will not propagate through the Bitcoin network.

`max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat` is a cap on total value of outstanding HTLCs, which allows a node to limit its exposure to HTLCs; similarly `max_accepted_htlcs` limits the number of outstanding HTLCs the other node can offer. `channel_reserve_satoshis` is the minimum amount that the other node is to keep as a direct payment. `htlc_minimum_msat` indicates the smallest value HTLC this node will accept.

`feerate_per_kw` indicates the initial fee rate by 1000-weight (ie. 1/4 the more normally-used 'feerate per kilobyte') which this side will pay for commitment and HTLC transactions as described in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#fee-calculation) (this can be adjusted later with an `update_fee` message).  `to_self_delay` is the number of blocks that the other nodes to-self outputs must be delayed, using `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` delays; this is how long it will have to wait in case of breakdown before redeeming its own funds.

Only the least-significant bit of `channel_flags` is currently
defined: `announce_channel`.  This indicates whether the initiator of the
funding flow wishes to advertise this channel publicly to the network
as detailed within
[BOLT #7](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/07-routing-gossip.md#bolt-7-p2p-node-and-channel-discovery).

The `funding_pubkey` is the public key in the 2-of-2 multisig script of the funding transaction output.  The `revocation_basepoint` is combined with the revocation preimage for this commitment transaction to generate a unique revocation key for this commitment transaction. The `payment_basepoint` and `delayed_payment_basepoint` are similarly used to generate a series of keys for any payments to this node: `delayed_payment_basepoint` is used to for payments encumbered by a delay.  Varying these keys ensures that the transaction ID of each commitment transaction is unpredictable by an external observer, even if one commitment transaction is seen: this property is very useful for preserving privacy when outsourcing penalty transactions to third parties.

`funding_tx` is an unsigned, partial funding transaction that can be used by the receiver to add funds to the channel ("dual funding").

FIXME: Describe Dangerous feature bit for larger channel amounts.


#### Requirements

A sending node MUST ensure that the `chain_hash` value identifies the chain they
they wish to open the channel within.

A sending node MUST ensure `temporary_channel_id` is unique from any other
channel id with the same peer.  The sender MUST set `funding_satoshis`
to less than 2^24 satoshi.  The sender MUST set `push_msat` to
equal or less than to 1000 * `funding_satoshis`.   The sender SHOULD set `to_self_delay` sufficient to ensure the sender
can irreversibly spend a commitment transaction output in case of
misbehavior by the receiver.
`funding_pubkey`, `revocation_basepoint`, `payment_basepoint` and `delayed_payment_basepoint` MUST be valid DER-encoded
compressed secp256k1 pubkeys. The sender SHOULD set `feerate_per_kw`
to at least the rate it estimates would cause the transaction to be
immediately included in a block.


The sender SHOULD set `dust_limit_satoshis` to a sufficient value to
allow commitment transactions to propagate through the Bitcoin
network.  It SHOULD set `htlc_minimum_msat` to the minimum
amount HTLC it is willing to accept from this peer.

The receiving node MAY fail the channel if `announce_channel` is
`false` (`0`), yet they wish to publicly announce the channel.  The
receiving node MUST ignore undefined bits in `channel_flags`.

The receiving node MUST accept a new `open_channel` message if the
connection has been re-established after receiving a previous
`open_channel` and before receiving a `funding_created` message.  In
this case, the receiving node MUST discard the previous `open_channel`
message.

The receiving node MUST fail the channel if `to_self_delay` is
unreasonably large.  The receiver MAY fail the channel if
`funding_satoshis` is too small, and MUST fail the channel if
`push_msat` is greater than `funding_satoshis` * 1000.
The receiving node MAY fail the channel if it considers
`htlc_minimum_msat` too large, `max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat` too small, `channel_reserve_satoshis` too large, or `max_accepted_htlcs` too small.  It MUST fail the channel if `max_accepted_htlcs` is greater than 483.

The receiver MUST fail the channel if it
considers `feerate_per_kw` too small for timely processing, or unreasonably large.  The
receiver MUST fail the channel if `funding_pubkey`, `revocation_basepoint`, `payment_basepoint` or `delayed_payment_basepoint`
are not valid DER-encoded compressed secp256k1 pubkeys.


The receiver MUST NOT consider funds received using `push_msat` to be received until the funding transaction has reached sufficient depth.

The sender must set `len` to the length of the serialized, unsigned, partial funding transaction, which MUST be followed by the transaction itself.

`partial_funding_tx` is an unsigned, partial funding transaction that includes:
 * inputs that the sender wants to use to fund the channel. These inputs MUST be either P2WPKH or P2WSH and must include the witness script in their signature script field.
 * an optional change output
 
Please note that this partial transaction does not include the multisig funding output, since the sender does not know the receiver's public key yet.

#### Rationale


The *channel reserve* is specified by the peer's `channel_reserve_satoshis`; 1% of the channel total is suggested.  Each side of a channel maintains this reserve so it always has something to lose if it were to try to broadcast an old, revoked commitment transaction.  Initially this reserve may not be met, as only one side has funds, but the protocol ensures that progress is always toward it being met, and once met it is maintained.


The sender can unconditionally give initial funds to the receiver using a non-zero `push_msat`, and this is one case where the normal reserve mechanism doesn't apply.  However, like any other on-chain transaction, this payment is not certain until the funding transaction has been confirmed sufficiently (may be double-spent) and may require a separate method to prove payment via on-chain confirmation.

The `feerate_per_kw` is generally only a concern to the sender (who pays the fees), but that is also the feerate paid by HTLC transactions; thus unreasonably large fee rates can also penalize the recipient.

#### Future


It would be easy to have a local feature bit which indicated that a
receiving node was prepared to fund a channel, which would reverse this
protocol.


### The `accept_channel` message


This message contains information about a node, and indicates its
acceptance of the new channel.


1. type: 33 (`accept_channel`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`temporary_channel_id`]
   * [`8`:`dust_limit_satoshis`]
   * [`8`:`max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat`]
   * [`8`:`channel_reserve_satoshis`]
   * [`8`:`htlc_minimum_msat`]
   * [`4`:`minimum_depth`]
   * [`2`:`to_self_delay`]
   * [`2`:`max_accepted_htlcs`]
   * [`33`:`funding_pubkey`]
   * [`33`:`revocation_basepoint`]
   * [`33`:`payment_basepoint`]
   * [`33`:`delayed_payment_basepoint`]
   * [`33`:`first_per_commitment_point`]
   * [`2`:`len`]
   * [`len`:`funding_tx`]
   * [`64`:`signature`]

#### Requirements


The receiving node MUST reject the channel if the `chain_hash` value within the
`open_channel` message is set to a hash of a chain unknown to the receiver.

The `temporary_channel_id` MUST be the same as the `temporary_channel_id` in the `open_channel` message.  The sender SHOULD set `minimum_depth` to a number of blocks it considers reasonable to avoid double-spending of the funding transaction.

The receiver MAY reject the `minimum_depth` if it considers it unreasonably large.
Other fields have the same requirements as their counterparts in `open_channel`.

The sender can choose to also fund the channel, so that they can start with a positive balance and can use the channel to pay right away.

The sender MUST set `len` to the length of an unsigned funding transaction, followed by the serialized funding transaction.
`funding_tx` is an unsigned funding transaction which includes:
 * optional additional inputs that the sender wants to use to fund the channel. These inputs MUST be either P2WPKH or P2WSH and must include the witness script in their signature script field.
 * an optional change output
 * a funding transaction output as defined in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#funding-transaction-output)
The sender MUST then set `signature` to the valid signature using its funding_pubkey for the initial commitment transaction as defined in BOLT #3
 
The amount that the sender will start with, i.e. that will be included in his first commit transaction, is the difference between the additional inputs
and the change output.

If the sender does not wish to fund the channel, they MAY set `len` to 0 and not include the funding transaction since the
receiver will have both public keys and will be able to build it.

#### Rationale

Once `accept_channel` has been received, both nodes have an unsigned funding transaction that cannot be malleated (all 
inputs are segwit inputs) and can be used to create commitment transactions.
They can easily compute the `funding txid` and find the `funding output index` (they just need to find a match for the funding 
transaction output defined in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#funding-transaction-output) which they can both compute since 
they know both public keys).

### The `funding_created` message

This message describes the funding transaction that the funder has created for
the initial commitment transactions.  After receiving the peer's
signature, it will broadcast the funding transaction.

1. type: 34 (`funding_created`)
2. data:
    * [`32`:`temporary_channel_id`]
    * [`64`:`signature`]

#### Requirements

The sender MUST set `temporary_channel_id` the same as the `temporary_channel_id` in the `open_channel` message.  
The sender MUST set `signature` to the valid signature using its `funding_pubkey` for the initial commitment transaction as defined in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#commitment-transaction).  

The recipient MUST fail the channel if `signature` is incorrect.

#### Rationale

Once this message has been received, both nodes will have a signed commitment transaction, and an unsigned funding transaction.

### The `funding_signed` message

This message gives the funder the signature they need for the first
commitment transaction, so they can broadcast it knowing they can
redeem their funds if they need to.

This message introduces the `channel_id` to identify the channel, which is derived from the funding transaction by combining 
the `funding txid` and the `funding output index` using big-endian exclusive-OR (ie. `funding output index` alters 
the last two bytes).

1. type: 35 (`funding_signed`)
2. data:
    * [`32`:`channel_id`]
    * [`2`:`len`]
    * [`len`:`funding_tx`]

#### Requirements

The sender MUST set `channel_id` by exclusive-OR of `funding_txid` and `funding_output_index`.
The sender MUST set `len` to the length of the partially signed funding transaction, followed by the serialized funding transaction.
The sender MUST include valid witnesses for all inputs added by their `accept_channel` message

The recipient MUST fail the channel if any of these witnesses are missing or incorrect.

The recipient SHOULD broadcast the funding transaction on receipt of a valid `funding_signed` and MUST NOT broadcast the funding transaction earlier.

#### Rationale

Once they have received and checked `funding_signed`, the receiving node will have a fully signed funding transaction, which 
they can now broadcast since they already have a signed commit transaction. 

### The `funding_locked` message

This message indicates that the funding transaction has reached the `minimum_depth` asked for in `accept_channel`.  Once both nodes have sent this, the channel enters normal operating mode.

1. type: 36 (`funding_locked`)
2. data:
    * [`32`:`channel_id`]
    * [`33`:`next_per_commitment_point`]

#### Requirements

The sender MUST wait until the funding transaction has reached
`minimum_depth` before sending this message.

The sender MUST set `next_per_commitment_point` to the
per-commitment point to be used for the following commitment
transaction, derived as specified in
[BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#per-commitment-secret-requirements).

A non-funding node SHOULD forget the channel if it does not see the
funding transaction after a reasonable timeout.

From the point of waiting for `funding_locked` onward, a node MAY
fail the channel if it does not receive a required response from the
other node after a reasonable timeout.

#### Rationale

The non-funder can simply forget the channel ever existed, since no
funds are at risk; even if `push_msat` is significant, if it remembers
the channel forever on the promise of the funding transaction finally
appearing, there is a denial of service risk.

#### Future

We could add an SPV proof, and route block hashes in separate
messages.

## Channel Close

Nodes can negotiate a mutual close for the connection, which unlike a
unilateral close, allows them to access their funds immediately and
can be negotiated with lower fees.

Closing happens in two stages: the first is by one side indicating
that it wants to clear the channel (and thus will accept no new
HTLCs), and once all HTLCs are resolved, the final channel close
negotiation begins.

        +-------+                              +-------+
        |       |--(1)-----  shutdown  ------->|       |
        |       |<-(2)-----  shutdown  --------|       |
        |       |                              |       |
        |       | <complete all pending HTLCs> |       |
        |   A   |                 ...          |   B   |
        |       |                              |       |
        |       |<-(3)-- closing_signed  F1----|       |
        |       |--(4)-- closing_signed  F2--->|       |
        |       |              ...             |       |
        |       |--(?)-- closing_signed  Fn--->|       |
        |       |<-(?)-- closing_signed  Fn----|       |
        +-------+                              +-------+


### Closing initiation: `shutdown`

Either node (or both) can send a `shutdown` message to initiate closing,
and indicating the scriptpubkey it wants to be paid to.


1. type: 38 (`shutdown`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`2`:`len`]
   * [`len`:`scriptpubkey`]

#### Requirements

A node MUST NOT send a `shutdown` if there are updates pending
on the receiving node's commitment transaction.

A node MUST NOT send an `update_add_htlc` after a `shutdown`.  A sending node
SHOULD fail to route any HTLC added after it sent `shutdown`.

A sending node MUST set `scriptpubkey` to one of the following forms:

1. `OP_DUP` `OP_HASH160` `20` 20-bytes `OP_EQUALVERIFY` `OP_CHECKSIG`
   (pay to pubkey hash), OR
2. `OP_HASH160` `20` 20-bytes `OP_EQUAL` (pay to script hash), OR
3. `OP_0` `20` 20-bytes (version 0 pay to witness pubkey), OR
4. `OP_0` `32` 32-bytes (version 0 pay to witness script hash)

A receiving node SHOULD fail the connection if the `scriptpubkey` is not one
of those forms.

A receiving node MUST reply to a `shutdown` message with a `shutdown` once there are no outstanding updates on the peer, unless it has already sent a `shutdown`.

#### Rationale

If channel state is always "clean" (no pending changes) when a
shutdown starts, we avoid the question of how to behave if it wasn't;
the sender always send an `commitment_signed` first.

As shutdown implies a desire to terminate, it implies that no new
HTLCs will be added or accepted.

The `scriptpubkey` forms include only standard forms accepted by the
Bitcoin network, ensuring that the resulting transaction will
propagate to miners.

The `shutdown` response requirement implies that the node sends `commitment_signed` to commit any outstanding changes before replying, but it could theoretically reconnect instead, which simply erases all outstanding uncommitted changes.

### Closing negotiation: `closing_signed`

Once shutdown is complete and the channel is empty of HTLCs, the final
current commitment transactions will have no HTLCs, and closing fee
negotiation begins.  Each node chooses a fee it thinks is fair, and
signs the close transaction with the `scriptpubkey` fields from the
`shutdown` messages and that fee, and sends the signature.  The
process terminates when both agree on the same fee, or one side fails
the channel.

1. type: 39 (`closing_signed`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`8`:`fee_satoshis`]
   * [`64`:`signature`]

#### Requirements

Nodes SHOULD send a `closing_signed` message after `shutdown` has
been received and no HTLCs remain in either commitment transaction.

A sending node MUST set `fee_satoshis` lower than or equal to the
base fee of the final commitment transaction as calculated in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#fee-calculation).

The sender SHOULD set the initial `fee_satoshis` according to its
estimate of cost of inclusion in a block.

The sender MUST set `signature` to the Bitcoin signature of the close
transaction as specified in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#closing-transaction).

The receiver MUST check `signature` is valid for either variant of close
transaction specified in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#closing-transaction),
and MUST fail the connection if it is not.

If `fee_satoshis` is equal to its previously sent `fee_satoshis`, the receiver
SHOULD sign and broadcast the final closing transaction and MAY close the connection.

Otherwise, the
recipient MUST fail the connection if `fee_satoshis` is greater than
the base fee of the final commitment transaction as calculated in
[BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#fee-calculation), and the
recipient SHOULD fail the connection if `fee_satoshis` is not strictly
between its last-sent `fee_satoshis` and its previously-received
`fee_satoshis`, unless it has reconnected since then.

If the receiver agrees with the fee, it SHOULD reply with a
`closing_signed` with the same `fee_satoshis` value, otherwise it
MUST propose a value strictly between the received `fee_satoshis`
and its previously-sent `fee_satoshis`.

#### Rationale

The "strictly between" requirements ensure that we make forward
progress, even if only by a single satoshi at a time.  To avoid
keeping state and handle the corner case where fees have shifted
between disconnection and reconnection, negotiation restarts on reconnection.

Note that there is limited risk if the closing transaction is
delayed, and it will be broadcast very soon, so there is usually no
reason to pay a premium for rapid processing.

## Normal Operation

Once both nodes have exchanged `funding_locked` (and optionally [`announcement_signatures`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/07-routing-gossip.md#the-announcement_signatures-message)), the channel can be used to make payments via Hash TimeLocked Contracts.

Changes are sent in batches: one or more `update_` messages are sent before a
`commitment_signed` message, as in the following diagram:

        +-------+                            +-------+
        |       |--(1)---- add_htlc   ------>|       |
        |       |--(2)---- add_htlc   ------>|       |
        |       |<-(3)---- add_htlc   -------|       |
        |       |                            |       |
        |       |--(4)----   commit   ------>|       |
        |   A   |                            |   B   |
        |       |<-(5)--- revoke_and_ack-----|       |
        |       |<-(6)----   commit   -------|       |
        |       |                            |       |
        |       |--(7)--- revoke_and_ack---->|       |
        +-------+                            +-------+


Counterintuitively, these updates apply to the *other node's*
commitment transaction; the node only adds those updates to its own
commitment transaction when the remote node acknowledges it has
applied them via `revoke_and_ack`.

Thus each update traverses through the following states:

1. Pending on the receiver
2. In the receiver's latest commitment transaction,
3. ... and the receiver's previous commitment transaction has been revoked,
   and the HTLC is pending on the sender.
4. ... and in the sender's latest commitment transaction
5. ... and the sender's previous commitment transaction has been revoked


As the two nodes updates are independent, the two commitment
transactions may be out of sync indefinitely.  This is not concerning:
what matters is whether both sides have irrevocably committed to a
particular HTLC or not (the final state, above).

### Forwarding HTLCs

In general, a node offers HTLCs for two reasons: to initiate a payment of its own, 
or to forward a payment coming from another node. In the forwarding case, care must 
be taken to ensure that the *outgoing* HTLC cannot be redeemed unless the *incoming* 
HTLC can be redeemed; these requirements ensure that is always true.

The addition/removal of an HTLC is considered *irrevocably committed* when:

1. the commitment transaction with/without it it is committed by both nodes, and any 
previous commitment transaction which without/with it has been revoked, OR
2. the commitment transaction with/without it has been irreversibly committed to 
the blockchain.

#### Requirements

A node MUST NOT offer an HTLC (`update_add_htlc`) in response to an incoming HTLC until 
the incoming HTLC has been irrevocably committed.

A node MUST NOT fail an incoming HTLC (`update_fail_htlc`) for which it has committed 
to an outgoing HTLC, until the removal of the outgoing HTLC is irrevocably committed, or the outgoing on-chain HTLC output has been spent via the HTLC-timeout transaction with sufficient depth.

A node MUST fail an incoming HTLC (`update_fail_htlc`) once its `cltv_expiry` has been reached, or if `cltv_expiry` - `current_height` < `cltv_expiry_delta` for the outgoing channel.
 
A node SHOULD fail an incoming HTLC (`update_fail_htlc`) if its `cltv_expiry` is unreasonably far in the future.

A node MUST fulfill an incoming HTLC for which it has committed to an outgoing HTLC,
as soon as it receives `update_fulfill_htlc` for the outgoing HTLC, or has discovered the `payment_preimage` from an on-chain HTLC spend.

#### Rationale

In general, we need to complete one side of the exchange before dealing with the other.
Fulfilling an HTLC is different: knowledge of the preimage is by definition irrevocable, 
so we should fulfill the incoming HTLC as soon as we can to reduce latency.

An HTLC with an extremely long expiry is a denial-of-service vector,
so it is not allowed: the exact value of "unreasonable" is currently unclear
and may depend on network topology.

### `cltv_expiry_delta` Selection


Once an HTLC has timed out it could either be fulfilled or timed-out;
care must be taken around this transition both for offered and received HTLCs.

Consider the following scenario, where A sends an HTLC to B, who
forwards to C, who delivers the goods as soon as the payment is
received.

1.  C needs to be sure that the HTLC from B cannot time out, even if B becomes
    unresponsive; i.e. C can fulfill the incoming HTLC on-chain before B can
    time it out on-chain.

2.  B needs to be sure that if C fulfills the HTLC from B, it can fulfill the
    incoming HTLC from A.  i.e. B can get the preimage from C and fulfill incoming the
    HTLC on-chain before A can time it out on-chain.

The critical settings here are the `cltv_expiry_delta` in
[BOLT #7](07-routing-gossip.md#the-channel_update-message), and the
related
[`min_final_cltv_expiry` in BOLT #11](11-payment-encoding.md#tagged-fields).
`cltv_expiry_delta` is the minimum difference in HTLC CLTV timeouts in
the forwarding case (B) and `min_final_ctlv_expiry` is the minimum difference
between HTLC CLTV timeout and the current block height for the
terminal case (C).

Note that if this value is too low for a channel, the risk is only to
the node *accepting* the HTLC, not the node offering it.  For this
reason, the `cltv_expiry_delta` for the *outgoing* channel is used as
the delta across a node.

We can derive the worst-case number of blocks between outgoing and
incoming HTLC resolution, given a few assumptions:

* A worst-case reorganization depth `R` blocks
* A grace-period `G` blocks after HTLC timeout before we give up on
  an unresponsive peer and drop to chain.
* A number of blocks `S` between transaction broadcast and the
  transaction being included in a block.

The worst case is for a forwarding node (B) which takes the longest
possible time to spot the outgoing HTLC fulfillment, and then takes
the longest possible time to redeem it on-chain:

1. The B->C HTLC times out at block `N`, and B waits `G` blocks until
   it gives up waiting for C.  B or C commits to the blockchain,
   and B spends HTLC, which takes `S` blocks to be included.
2. Bad case: C wins the race (just) and fulfills the HTLC, B only sees
   that transaction when it sees block `N+G+S+1`.
3. Worst case: There's reorganization `R` deep in which C wins and
   fulfills. B only sees transaction at `N+G+S+R`.
4. B now needs to fulfill the incoming A->B HTLC, but A is unresponsive: B waits `G` more
   blocks before giving up waiting for A.  A or B commits to the blockchain.
5. Bad case: B sees A's commitment transaction in block `N+G+S+R+G+1`, and has
   to spend the HTLC output, which takes `S` blocks to be mined.
6. Worst case: There's another reorganization `R` deep which A uses to
   spend the commitment transaction, so B sees A's commitment
   transaction in block `N+G+S+R+G+R`, and has to spend the HTLC output, which
   takes `S` blocks to be mined.
7. B's HTLC spend needs to be at least `R` deep before it times out,
   otherwise another reorganization could allow A to timeout the
   transaction.

Thus the worst case is `3R+2G+2S` assuming `R` is at least 1.  Note that the
chances of three reorganizations in which the other node wins all of them is
low for `R` of 2 or more.  Since we use high fees (and HTLC spends can use
almost arbitrary fees) `S` should be small, though given that block times are
irregular and empty blocks still occur, `S = 2` should be considered a
minimum.  Similarly, the grace period `G` can be low (1 or 2), as nodes are
required to timeout or fulfill as soon as possible; but too low increases the
risk of unnecessary channel closure due to networking delays.

There are four values we need to derive:

1. The `cltv_expiry_delta` for channels.  `3R+2G+2S`; if in doubt, a
   `cltv_expiry_delta` of 12 is reasonable (R=2, G=1, S=2).

2. For HTLCs we offer: the timeout deadline when we have to fail the channel
   and time it out on-chain.  This is `G` blocks after the HTLC
   `cltv_expiry`; 1 block is reasonable.

3. For HTLCs we accept and have a preimage: the fulfillment deadline when we
   have to fail the channel and fulfill the HTLC onchain before its
   `cltv_expiry`.  This is steps 4-7 above, which means a deadline of `2R+G+S`
   blocks before `cltv_expiry`; 7 blocks is reasonable.

4. The minimum `cltv_expiry` we will accept for terminal payments: the
   worst case for the terminal node C lower at `2R+G+S` blocks (steps
   1-3 above don't apply).  The default in
   [BOLT 11](11-payment-encoding.md) is 9, which is slightly more
   conservative than the 6 this calculation suggests.


#### Requirements

A node MUST estimate a timeout deadline for each HTLC it offers.  A node MUST
NOT offer an HTLC with a timeout deadline before its `cltv_expiry`, and MUST
fail the channel if an HTLC which it offered is in either node's current
commitment transaction past this timeout deadline.

A node MUST estimate a fulfillment deadline for each HTLC it is attempting to
fulfill.  A node MUST fail (and not forward) an HTLC whose fulfillment
deadline is already past, and MUST fail the connection if a HTLC it has
fulfilled is in either node's current commitment transaction past this
fulfillment deadline.


### Adding an HTLC: `update_add_htlc`


Either node can send `update_add_htlc` to offer a HTLC to the other,
which is redeemable in return for a payment preimage.  Amounts are in
millisatoshi, though on-chain enforcement is only possible for whole
satoshi amounts greater than the dust limit: in commitment transactions these are rounded down as
specified in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md).


The format of the `onion_routing_packet` portion, which indicates where the payment
is destined, is described in [BOLT #4](04-onion-routing.md).


1. type: 128 (`update_add_htlc`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`8`:`id`]
   * [`8`:`amount_msat`]
   * [`32`:`payment_hash`]
   * [`4`:`cltv_expiry`]
   * [`1366`:`onion_routing_packet`]


#### Requirements

A sending node MUST NOT offer `amount_msat` it cannot pay for in the
remote commitment transaction at the current `feerate_per_kw` (see "Updating
Fees") while maintaining its channel reserve, MUST offer
`amount_msat` greater than 0, MUST NOT offer `amount_msat` below
the receiving node's `htlc_minimum_msat`, and MUST set `cltv_expiry` less
than 500000000.

For channels with `chain_hash` identifying the Bitcoin blockchain, the
sending node MUST set the 4 most significant bytes of `amount_msat` to
zero.

A sending node MUST NOT add an HTLC if it would result in it offering
more than the remote's `max_accepted_htlcs` HTLCs in the remote commitment
transaction, or if the sum of total offered HTLCs would exceed the remote's 
`max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat`.

A sending node MUST set `id` to 0 for the first HTLC it offers, and
increase the value by 1 for each successive offer.

A receiving node SHOULD fail the channel if it receives an
`amount_msat` equal to zero, below its own `htlc_minimum_msat`, or
which the sending node cannot afford at the current `feerate_per_kw` while
maintaining its channel reserve.  A receiving node SHOULD fail the
channel if a sending node adds more than its `max_accepted_htlcs` HTLCs to
its local commitment transaction, or adds more than its `max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat` worth of offered HTLCs to its local commitment transaction, or
sets `cltv_expiry` to greater or equal to 500000000.

For channels with `chain_hash` identifying the Bitcoin blockchain, the
receiving node MUST fail the channel if the 4 most significant bytes
of `amount_msat` are not zero.

A receiving node MUST allow multiple HTLCs with the same payment hash.

A receiving node MUST ignore a repeated `id` value after a
reconnection if the sender did not previously acknowledge the
commitment of that HTLC.  A receiving node MAY fail the channel if
other `id` violations occur.

The `onion_routing_packet` contains an obfuscated list of hops and instructions for each hop along the path.
It commits to the HTLC by setting the `payment_hash` as associated data, i.e., including the `payment_hash` in the computation of HMACs.
This prevents replay attacks that'd reuse a previous `onion_routing_packet` with a different `payment_hash`.

#### Rationale


Invalid amounts are a clear protocol violation and indicate a
breakdown.


If a node did not accept multiple HTLCs with the same payment hash, an
attacker could probe to see if a node had an existing HTLC.  This
requirement to deal with duplicates leads us to use a separate
identifier; we assume a 64 bit counter never wraps.


Retransmissions of unacknowledged updates are explicitly allowed for
reconnection purposes; allowing them at other times simplifies the
recipient code, though strict checking may help debugging.

`max_accepted_htlcs` is limited to 483, to ensure that even if both
sides send the maximum number of HTLCs, the `commitment_signed` message will
still be under the maximum message size.  It also ensures that
a single penalty transaction can spend the entire commitment transaction,
as calculated in [BOLT #5](05-onchain.md#penalty-transaction-weight-calculation).

`cltv_expiry` values equal or above 500000000 would indicate a time in
seconds, and the protocol only supports an expiry in blocks.

`amount_msat` is deliberately limited for this version of the
specification; larger amounts are not necessary nor wise during the
bootstrap phase of the network.

### Removing an HTLC: `update_fulfill_htlc`, `update_fail_htlc` and `update_fail_malformed_htlc`

For simplicity, a node can only remove HTLCs added by the other node.
There are three reasons for removing an HTLC: it has timed out, it has
failed to route, or the payment preimage is supplied.

The `reason` field is an opaque encrypted blob for the benefit of the
original HTLC initiator as defined in [BOLT #4](04-onion-routing.md),
but there's a special malformed failure variant for the case where
our peer couldn't parse it; in this case the current node encrypts
it into a `update_fail_htlc` for relaying.

1. type: 130 (`update_fulfill_htlc`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`8`:`id`]
   * [`32`:`payment_preimage`]

For a timed out or route-failed HTLC:

1. type: 131 (`update_fail_htlc`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`8`:`id`]
   * [`2`:`len`]
   * [`len`:`reason`]

For a unparsable HTLC:

1. type: 135 (`update_fail_malformed_htlc`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`8`:`id`]
   * [`32`:`sha256_of_onion`]
   * [`2`:`failure_code`]

#### Requirements

A node SHOULD remove an HTLC as soon as it can; in particular, a node
SHOULD fail an HTLC which has timed out.

A node MUST NOT send an `update_fulfill_htlc`, `update_fail_htlc` or 
`update_fail_malformed_htlc` until the corresponding HTLC is irrevocably 
committed in both sides' commitment transactions.

A receiving node MUST check that `id` corresponds to an HTLC in its
current commitment transaction, and MUST fail the channel if it does
not.

A receiving node MUST check that the `payment_preimage` value in
`update_fulfill_htlc` SHA256 hashes to the corresponding HTLC
`payment_hash`, and MUST fail the channel if it does not.

A receiving node MUST fail the channel if the `BADONION` bit in
`failure_code` is not set for `update_fail_malformed_htlc`.

A receiving node MAY check the `sha256_of_onion` in
`update_fail_malformed_htlc` and MAY retry or choose an alternate
error response if it does not match the onion it sent.

Otherwise, a receiving node which has an outgoing HTLC canceled by
`update_fail_malformed_htlc` MUST return an error in the
`update_fail_htlc` sent to the link which originally sent the HTLC
using the `failure_code` given and setting the data to
`sha256_of_onion`.

#### Rationale

A node which doesn't time out HTLCs risks channel failure (see
[`cltv_expiry_delta` Selection](#cltv_expiry_delta-selection).

A node which sends `update_fulfill_htlc` before the sender is also
committed to the HTLC risks losing funds.

If the onion is malformed, the upstream node won't be able to extract
a key to generate a response, hence the special failure message which
makes this node do it.

The node can check that the SHA256 the upstream is complaining about
does match the onion it sent, which may allow it to detect random bit
errors.  Without re-checking the actual encrypted packet sent, however,
it won't know whether the error was its own or on the remote side, so
such detection is left as an option.

### Committing Updates So Far: `commitment_signed`


When a node has changes for the remote commitment, it can apply them,
sign the resulting transaction as defined in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md) and send a
`commitment_signed` message.


1. type: 132 (`commitment_signed`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`64`:`signature`]
   * [`2`:`num_htlcs`]
   * [`num_htlcs*64`:`htlc_signature`]

#### Requirements


A node MUST NOT send a `commitment_signed` message which does not include any
updates.  Note that a node MAY send a `commitment_signed` message which only
alters the fee, and MAY send a `commitment_signed` message which doesn't
change the commitment transaction other than the new revocation hash
(due to dust, identical HTLC replacement, or insignificant or multiple
fee changes).  A node MUST include one `htlc_signature` for every HTLC
transaction corresponding to BIP69 lexicographic ordering of the commitment
transaction.


A receiving node MUST fail the channel if `signature` is not valid for
its local commitment transaction once all pending updates are applied.
A receiving node MUST fail the channel if `num_htlcs` is not equal to
the number of HTLC outputs in the local commitment transaction once all
pending updates are applied.  A receiving node MUST fail the channel if
any `htlc_signature` is not valid for the corresponding HTLC transaction.


A receiving node MUST respond with a `revoke_and_ack` message.


#### Rationale


There's little point offering spam updates; it implies a bug.


The `num_htlcs` field is redundant, but makes the packet length check fully self-contained.


### Completing the transition to the updated state: `revoke_and_ack`


Once the recipient of `commitment_signed` checks the signature, it knows that
it has a valid new commitment transaction, replies with the commitment
preimage for the previous commitment transaction in a `revoke_and_ack`
message.


This message also implicitly serves as an acknowledgment of receipt
of the `commitment_signed`, so it's a logical time for the `commitment_signed` sender
to apply to its own commitment, any pending updates it sent before
that `commitment_signed`.


The description of key derivation is in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#key-derivation).


1. type: 133 (`revoke_and_ack`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`32`:`per_commitment_secret`]
   * [`33`:`next_per_commitment_point`]

#### Requirements


A sending node MUST set `per_commitment_secret` to the secret used to generate keys for the
previous commitment transaction, MUST set `next_per_commitment_point` to the values for its next commitment transaction.

A receiving node MUST check that `per_commitment_secret` generates the previous `per_commitment_point`, and MUST fail if it does not. A receiving node MAY fail if the `per_commitment_secret` was not generated by the protocol in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#per-commitment-secret-requirements).

Nodes MUST NOT broadcast old (revoked) commitment transactions; doing
so will allow the other node to seize all the funds.  Nodes SHOULD NOT
sign commitment transactions unless it is about to broadcast them (due
to a failed connection), to reduce this risk.

### Updating Fees: `update_fee`

An `update_fee` message is sent by the node which is paying the
bitcoin fee.  Like any update, it is first committed to the receiver's
commitment transaction, then (once acknowledged) committed to the
sender's.  Unlike an HTLC, `update_fee` is never closed, simply
replaced.

There is a possibility of a race: the recipient can add new HTLCs
before it receives the `update_fee`, and the sender may not be able to
afford the fee on its own commitment transaction once the `update_fee`
is acknowledged by the recipient.  In this case, the fee will be less
than the fee rate, as described in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#fee-payment).

The exact calculation used for deriving the fee from the fee rate is
given in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#fee-calculation).


1. type: 134 (`update_fee`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`4`:`feerate_per_kw`]

#### Requirements

The node which is responsible for paying the bitcoin fee SHOULD send
`update_fee` to ensure the current fee rate is sufficient for
timely processing of the commitment transaction by a significant
margin.

The node which is not responsible for paying the bitcoin fee MUST NOT
send `update_fee`.

A receiving node SHOULD fail the channel if the `update_fee` is too
low for timely processing, or unreasonably large.

A receiving node MUST fail the channel if the sender is not
responsible for paying the bitcoin fee.

A receiving node SHOULD fail the channel if the sender cannot afford
the new fee rate on the receiving node's current commitment
transaction, but it MAY delay this check until the `update_fee` is
committed.

#### Rationale

Bitcoin fees are required for unilateral closes to be effective,
particularly since there is no general method for the node which
broadcasts it to use child-pays-for-parent to increase its effective
fee.

Given the variance in fees, and the fact that the transaction may be
spent in the future, it's a good idea for the fee payer to keep a good
margin, say 5x the expected fee requirement, but differing methods of
fee estimation mean we don't specify an exact value.

Since the fees are currently one-sided (the party which requested the
channel creation always pays the fees for the commitment transaction),
it is simplest to only allow them to set fee levels, but as the same
fee rate applies to HTLC transactions, the receiving node must also
care about the reasonableness of the fee.

## Message Retransmission

Because communication transports are unreliable and may need to be
re-established from time to time, the design of the transport has been
explicitly separated from the protocol.

Nonetheless, we assume that our transport is ordered and reliable;
reconnection introduces doubt as to what has been received, so we
have explicit acknowledgments at that point.

This is fairly straightforward in the case of channel establishment
and close where messages have an explicit order, but in normal
operation acknowledgments of updates are delayed until the
`commitment_signed` / `revoke_and_ack` exchange, so we cannot assume
the updates have been received.  This also means that the receiving
node only needs to store updates upon receipt of `commitment_signed`.

Note that messages described in [BOLT #7](07-routing-gossip.md) are
independent of particular channels; their transmission requirements
are covered there, and other than being transmitted after `init` (like
any message), they are independent of requirements here.

1. type: 136 (`channel_reestablish`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`8`:`next_local_commitment_number`]
   * [`8`:`next_remote_revocation_number`]

### Requirements

A node MUST handle continuing a previous channel on a new encrypted
transport.

On disconnection, the funder MUST remember the channel for
reconnection if it has broadcast the funding transaction, otherwise it
SHOULD NOT.

On disconnection, the non-funding node MUST remember the channel for
reconnection if it has sent the `funding_signed` message, otherwise
it SHOULD NOT.

On disconnection, a node MUST reverse any uncommitted updates sent by
the other side (ie. all messages beginning with `update_` for which no
`commitment_signed` has been received).  Note that a node MAY have
already use the `payment_preimage` value from the `update_fulfill_htlc`,
so the effects of `update_fulfill_htlc` is not completely reversed.

On reconnection, if a channel is in an error state, the node SHOULD
retransmit the error packet and ignore any other packets for that
channel, and the following requirements do not apply.

On reconnection, a node MUST transmit `channel_reestablish`
for each channel, and MUST wait for to receive the other node's
`channel_reestablish` message before sending any other messages for
that channel.  The sending node MUST set `next_local_commitment_number` to the
commitment number of the next `commitment_signed` it expects to receive, and
MUST set `next_remote_revocation_number` to the commitment number of the
next `revoke_and_ack` message it expects to receive.

If `next_local_commitment_number` is 1 in both the `channel_reestablish` it
sent and received, then the node MUST retransmit `funding_locked`, otherwise
it MUST NOT. On reconnection, a node MUST ignore a redundant `funding_locked`
if it receives one.

If `next_local_commitment_number` is equal to the commitment number of
the last `commitment_signed` message the receiving node has sent, it
MUST reuse the same commitment number for its next `commitment_signed`,
otherwise if `next_local_commitment_number` is not one greater than the commitment number of the
last `commitment_signed` message the receiving node has sent, it
SHOULD fail the channel.

If `next_remote_revocation_number` is equal to the commitment number of
the last `revoke_and_ack` the receiving node has sent and the receiving node has not already received a `closing_signed`, it MUST re-send
the `revoke_and_ack`, otherwise if `next_remote_revocation_number` is not
equal to one greater than the commitment number of the last `revoke_and_ack` the
receiving node has sent (or equal to zero if none have been sent), it SHOULD fail the channel.

A node MUST not assume that previously-transmitted messages were lost:
in particular, if it has sent a previous `commitment_signed` message,
a node MUST handle the case where the corresponding commitment
transaction is broadcast by the other side at any time.  This is
particularly important if a node does not simply retransmit the exact
same `update_` messages as previously sent.

On reconnection if the node has sent a previous `closing_signed` it
MUST send another `closing_signed`, otherwise if the node
has sent a previous `shutdown` it MUST retransmit it.

### Rationale

The effect of requirements above are that the opening phase is almost
atomic: if it doesn't complete, it starts again.  The only exception
is where the `funding_signed` message is sent and not received: in
this case, the funder will forget the channel and presumably open
a new one on reconnect; the other node will eventually forget the
original channel due to never receiving `funding_locked` or seeing
the funding transaction on-chain.

There's no acknowledgment for `error`, so if a reconnect occurs it's
polite to retransmit before disconnecting again, but it's not a MUST
because there are also occasions where a node can simply forget the
channel altogether.

`closing_signed` has no acknowledgment, so must be transmitted again
on reconnect (though negotiation restarts on reconnection, so it need
not be an exact retransmission).  The only acknowledgment for
`shutdown` is `closing_signed`, so that needs to always be retransmitted
unless `closing_signed` is.

The handling of updates is similarly atomic: if the commit is not
acknowledged (or wasn't sent) the updates are re-sent.  However, we
don't insist they be identical: they could be in a different order, or
involve different fees, or even be missing HTLCs which are now too old
to be added.  Requiring they be identical would effectively mean a
write to disk by the sender upon each transmission, whereas the scheme
here encourages a single persistent write to disk for each
`commitment_signed` sent or received.

We should never be asked to retransmit `revoke_and_ack` if we've
received a `closing_signed`, since that implies we've completed
shutdown which can only happen once the `revoke_and_ack` was received
by the remote node.

Note that the `next_local_commitment_number` starts at 1 since
commitment number 0 is created during opening.
`next_remote_revocation_number` will be 0 until the
`commitment_signed` for commitment number 1 is received, at which
point the revocation for commitment number 0 is sent.

`funding_locked` is implicitly acknowledged by the start of normal
operation, which we know has begun once a `commitment_signed` has been
received, thus the test for a `next_local_commitment_number` greater
than 1.

A previous draft insisted that the funder "MUST remember ...if it has
broadcast the funding transaction, otherwise it MUST NOT": this was in
fact an impossible requirement, as a node must either first commit to
disk then broadcast the transaction, or the other way around.  The new
language reflects this reality: it's surely better to remember a
channel which hasn't been broadcast than forget one which has!
Similarly, for the fundee's `funding_signed` message; better to
remember a channel which never opens (and time out) than let the
funder open it with the funder having forgotten it.
